                Low-intermediate Japanese. Hundreds of hours both of my personal time and as part of a degree to learn to read,
                speak, and write
                Japanese. I try to study in the free time I’m granted, as Fluency in another/several languages, is a lifelong
                dream.

                Several years’ experience working with statistics as part of my university work in undergrad Psychology. Work
                done in interpreting data sets and categorizing information mostly using software, but some ‘manual’ statistical

                Bar all-rounder- as my work experience suggests I have quite a bit of experience in hospitality of varied sorts
                and retail. This is ranging from assessing and preparing fruits and vegetables/garnishes etc., to making
                cocktails, talking with customers, and remembering heinously long coffee orders in my regular bar.
